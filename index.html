	<p class="paragraph">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to a class of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. These conditions can include coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, stroke, and other disorders that impact the circulatory system. CVD is a leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 17.9 million deaths attributed to the disease each year. Risk factors for CVD include age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and diabetes, among others. Treatment options for CVD can vary depending on the specific condition and severity of the disease, but may include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgical procedures. Preventative measures such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and managing risk factors can help reduce the risk of developing CVD.</p>
